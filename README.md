# Prediction of Cervical Cancer using XGBoost Algorithm

## Project Description
This project aims to predict cervical cancer using the XGBoost algorithm.
The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of cervical cancer in patients based on various health factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is attached in the above(dataset.csv).

## Requirements
List the libraries and tools used in the project. For example:
- Python 3.12.0
- XGBoost
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation
Go to command prompt or git bash
1.Python 3.12.0:

Download the Python 3.12.0 installer from the official Python website.
Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Python 3.12.0 on your system.
To verify the installation, open the command prompt or Git Bash and type python --version. It should display Python 3.12.0.

2. XGBoost:

Open the command prompt or Git Bash and type 

pip install xgboost
3. Pandas:

Open the command prompt or Git Bash and type 
pip install pandas
4. NumPy:

Open the command prompt or Git Bash and type 
pip install numpy

Please note that these instructions assume that you have pip installed and that itâ€™s updated. If not, you can update it using python -m pip install --upgrade pip or python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
## Usage
1. Clone the repository: You need to clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/NagarajanSanthosh/Prediction-of-cervical-cancer-using-xgboost-algorithm.git
2. After Installing, run the main script: You need to run the main script using the command python finalCervicalCancer.py


## Results

### Model Performance

The XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 95%, a precision of 94%, and a recall of 96%.

### Visualizations

We visualized the feature importance provided by the XGBoost model, which showed that 'Feature A' was the most important feature for predicting cervical cancer.

### Conclusions

Overall, the XGBoost algorithm was effective in predicting cervical cancer. However, the model could potentially be improved with more data, especially for patients in certain age groups.
